# Horiseon-Code-Refactor
I. File List:
    index.html
    README.md
    style.css

II. User Story:
AS A marketing agency. I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines

III. Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

IV. My Design:
    1. Modifed the given code from the client to meet client's criteria.
    2. Created comments in both html and css files.
    3. Wrote down a file description in te README file
